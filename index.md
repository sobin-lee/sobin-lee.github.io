This paper examines how targeted Medicaid reimbursement affects screening practices across payer types.  
Using linked birth records and All-Payer Claims data from 2012–2019, I find that practices with greater pre-policy Medicaid exposure increased screening more after the policy, mainly among commercially insured patients—consistent with practice-wide adoption rather than payer-specific targeting. Physician movers’ behavior indicates that about two-thirds of physicians adjust their screening toward the norms of their new practice, showing that organizational systems play a key role in shaping provider behavior.
